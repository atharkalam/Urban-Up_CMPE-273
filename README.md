# Urban Up - Hire a Contractor

Urban Up helps you hire a contractor. It allows users to create, browse, and interact with professionals. It uses Ethereum Payments that allow a payer to submit payment for an open request, and specify a service deposit. Any user can then commit to do the work by submitting the deposit. The payer then has the choice to release parts of the ether held in the payment, depending on whether and how well the worker has done the work.
